/**
 * Single-cell inference: one cell type's annotated layer geometry →
 * a structural circuit description (`CellExtraction`).
 *
 * `CellExtraction` is THE output data structure of this library. The die
 * netlister and the Verilog emitter consume it; nothing downstream should
 * reach back into raw geometry.
 *
 * A `CellExtraction` is one of two kinds:
 *   - "inferred"    — fully reverse-engineered: transistors, nets, Boolean
 *                     logic. Produced by `extractCell`.
 *   - "placeholder" — a cell too complex to infer automatically (flip-flops,
 *                     scan cells, …). Only its I/O ports are modelled; the
 *                     user supplies a hand-written Verilog module.
 * Both carry `ports` (the cell's I/O, derived from `wire_hitbox` shapes) and
 * `warnings`.
 *
 * Pipeline for "inferred" cells (implemented below):
 *
 *   1. Split each diffusion shape at every poly that crosses it. Each
 *      resulting sub-region remembers which polys carved its boundary, so
 *      step 4 can recover S/D pads without a separate adjacency heuristic.
 *   2. Build a union-find over metals + polys + diff sub-regions + contacts
 *      + vias. Same-layer overlap merges (positive-area only — shared edges
 *      stay split). Contacts/vias union across the layers they overlap.
 *      Pre-applied vcc/gnd/io labels propagate to the whole component.
 *   3. Infer each diffusion's P/N type from the rails its sub-regions touch.
 *      User-forced labels (`shape.label === "vcc" | "gnd"` on a diffusion)
 *      win; conflicting / unreachable cases warn.
 *   4. Emit transistors for every (poly, diffusion) overlap. The intersection
 *      may yield multiple disjoint regions (one transistor each). S/D pads
 *      come from the parent diffusion's sub-regions adjacent to that poly.
 *      `dummy` flags self-shorted transistors (gate + same net on both pads).
 *   5. Classify each net by what kind of terminals it touches: vcc/gnd/io,
 *      input (only gates), output (bridges PMOS↔NMOS S/D), internal, or
 *      unused. Cell-level checks flag missing rails / no output / etc.
 *
 * Out of scope (later passes): cell-name pattern matching, sequential
 * structure detection.
 *
 * Every Clipper op runs via `./clipper` so the algorithm stays unit-testable
 * once the WASM module is loaded (`loadClipper()`).

 * island's known members fire a CONFLICTING_DIFFUSION_TYPE error and the
 * majority wins (ties: lexicographic shape-id of one of the conflicting
 * sources, deterministic).
 *
 * ── KNOWN LIMITATION (future work) ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is a POST-INFERENCE patch on top of the per-diff splitting; the
 * splitter still runs once per ORIGINAL user-drawn diffusion shape and
 * each transistor emission step iterates `(poly, originalDiff)` pairs.
 * That works correctly when the user composes a complex diffusion body
 * out of multiple overlapping rects and polys only cross ONE rect at a
 * time (the realistic case). It does NOT handle the case where a poly
 * crosses the *overlap region* shared by two diff rects:
 *
 *     ┌────────────┐
 *     │  diff A    │
 *     │       ┌────┼────────┐
 *     │       │ ▓▓ │ diff B │       ▓▓ = overlap region
 *     │       │ ▓▓ │        │       || = poly running vertically
 *     └───────┼─║──┘        │             through the overlap
 *             │ ║           │
 *             └─╫───────────┘
 *               ║
 *
 * Step 4 (`emitTransistors`) iterates `(poly, A)` AND `(poly, B)`. Both
 * pairs have positive-area intersection in the overlap → both emit a
 * transistor → ONE physical device becomes TWO transistors in the
 * netlist. PUN/PDN clustering still works (they end up in the same
 * cluster via shared S/D nets), but you'd see an extra parallel device
 * in the right panel and schematic.
 *
 * THE PROPER FIX is to pre-union overlapping diffs into geometric
 * "islands" BEFORE the splitter runs, so the splitter operates on the
 * island polygon (one shape, one set of sub-regions) rather than each
 * member independently. That refactor touches:
 *   - `splitDiffusionsAtGates` (input becomes islands, sub-regions point
 *     to island id)
 *   - `InferredDiffusion` shape (per-island, with `memberIds`)
 *   - `emitTransistors` (iterates `(poly, island)` pairs)
 *   - every UI consumer that does `sub.parentDiffId` → single user-shape
 *     fold (`SchematicCanvas`, `CellRECanvas`, `CellRERightPanel`'s
 *     `shapesToSelectionKeys`) — these would fold to ALL member shapes
 *     so hovering a sub-region lights up every member rectangle
 *
 * Deferred because: the duplicate-transistor case requires a poly to
 * specifically cross an overlap region, which doesn't show up in the
 * "compose a complex diffusion via overlapping rects" use pattern we've
 * seen so far. If a cell exhibits the bug, the symptom is visible (one
 * extra transistor per crossing) and that's the signal to do the
 * refactor.
